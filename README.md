# odin-recipes

This is the first project I will make following The Odin Project's curriculum. This project is solely focused on basic HTML coding, by making a basic recipe website.

This project is also practice in creating new repositories in Github, and cloning them locally and setting up basic folder structure.

It is also practice in creating clear, concise commit messages, as well as frequent and structured commits so multiple snapshots exist,
that way there is a useful timeline for the entire project. This way multiple rollbacks are possible incase things break.
